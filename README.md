üìÅ File Structure

project-directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ubuntu_image_fetcher.py    # Main application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Fetched_Images/           # Created automatically
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...


Generated Files
‚Ä¢ **Fetched_Images/**: Directory where all downloaded images are stored
‚Ä¢ Images are saved with original or generated filenames
‚Ä¢ Duplicate filenames get automatic numbering (e.g., `image_1.jpg`, `image_2.jpg`)


üõ† Error Handling

The application handles various error scenarios gracefully:


Network Errors
‚Ä¢ **Connection Timeout**: Server takes too long to respond
‚Ä¢ **Connection Error**: Unable to reach server
‚Ä¢ **HTTP Errors**: 404, 403, 500, etc.


File System Errors
‚Ä¢ **Permission Denied**: Cannot write to directory
‚Ä¢ **Disk Space**: Insufficient storage space
‚Ä¢ **Path Issues**: Invalid file paths


Content Errors
‚Ä¢ **Invalid Content**: Non-image files
‚Ä¢ **Corrupted Data**: Incomplete downloads
‚Ä¢ **Large Files**: Warnings for files over 50MB


Example Error Messages

‚úó Connection timeout - server took too long to respond
‚úó Not an image file (Content-Type: text/html)
‚úó Duplicate image detected - skipping
‚ö† Large file size: 75.3MB
‚ö† Content-Type is 'application/octet-stream', not an image type


üîß Configuration

Customizable Settings

You can modify these constants in the code:


# Maximum file size warning threshold (bytes)
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB

# Request timeout (seconds)
TIMEOUT = 30

# Delay between batch requests (seconds)
REQUEST_DELAY = 1

# Output directory
BASE_DIR = "Fetched_Images"

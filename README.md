## 🔒 Security Features

**URL Validation**
- Ensures URLs use HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Validates URL structure and format
- Rejects malformed or suspicious URLs

**Content Verification**
- Verifies `Content-Type` headers indicate image files
- Checks file extensions match content types
- Warns about suspicious server responses

**Safe File Handling**
- Sanitizes filenames to prevent directory traversal
- Creates secure file paths within designated directory
- Handles filename conflicts automatically

**Network Security**
- Uses respectful User-Agent identification
- Implements connection timeouts
- Rate limits requests to be server-friendly

## 📁 File Structure

```
project-directory/
├── ubuntu_image_fetcher.py    # Main application
├── README.md                  # This file
└── Fetched_Images/            # Created automatically
    ├── image1.jpg
    ├── image2.png
    └── ...
```

**Generated Files**
- `Fetched_Images/`: Directory where all downloaded images are stored
- Images are saved with original or generated filenames
- Duplicate filenames get automatic numbering (e.g., `image_1.jpg`, `image_2.jpg`)

---

## 🛠 Error Handling

The application handles various error scenarios gracefully:

### Network Errors
- **Connection Timeout**: Server takes too long to respond
- **Connection Error**: Unable to reach server
- **HTTP Errors**: 404, 403, 500, etc.

### File System Errors
- **Permission Denied**: Cannot write to directory
- **Disk Space**: Insufficient storage space
- **Path Issues**: Invalid file paths

### Content Errors
- **Invalid Content**: Non-image files
- **Corrupted Data**: Incomplete downloads
- **Large Files**: Warnings for files over 50MB

**Example Error Messages**
- ✗ Connection timeout - server took too long to respond
- ✗ Not an image file (Content-Type: text/html)
- ✗ Duplicate image detected - skipping
- ⚠ Large file size: 75.3MB
- ⚠ Content-Type is 'application/octet-stream', not an image type

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Customizable Settings (edit these constants in the code):

```python
# Maximum file size warning threshold (bytes)
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB

# Request timeout (seconds)
TIMEOUT = 30

# Delay between batch requests (seconds)
REQUEST_DELAY = 1

# Output directory
BASE_DIR = "Fetched_Images"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module 'requests' not found"**
```bash
pip install requests
```

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory
- Try running from your home directory
- On Linux/Mac, check file permissions: `ls -la`

**Downloads failing consistently**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify URLs are accessible in a web browser
- Some sites may block automated requests

**Large memory usage**
- The tool loads entire images into memory
- For very large images, ensure sufficient RAM
- Consider downloading large files individually

**Getting Help**
- Check the error messages - they're designed to be helpful
- Verify URLs work in a web browser first
- Ensure you have proper internet connectivity
- Try with different image URLs to isolate issues
